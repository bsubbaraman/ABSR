### Week 10
What happened the last three weeks!? Gab had prelims and then it was Thanksgiving! 

News:
[DIS is happening this year!](https://dis.acm.org/2021/) Should we try to make the paper/pictorial deadline (prob late Jan)?

Let's focus more on RQ2. Specifically: 
- the politics of knowledge: which knowledge is valid, which is not, how does technology propagates a certain type of logic into the world... but does it?
- Politics of knowledge bring us back to Foucault, and also Isabelle Stengers
- The body as a site of knowledge that has been historically dismissed in computing (and I'm down to unpack that history for the paper)
- Work that deals with the body in interaction design and HCI often deals with the "medical" body, the visible body but there are interesting traditions that engage with the "invisible" or subtle body.
- What would it mean --politically and in terms of design possibilities-- to design for the subtle body?
  - magic machines workshop might be a good inspiration here.  

More inspiration: [Human-Computer Insurrection.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06167.pdf)

### Week 7
This week:
- making stuff!
  - Blair explores text message based interaction
  - Gabrielle explores sensory feedback at  a distance
- Research Questions:
  - RQ1: How can biodata foster long-distance intimacy?
  - RQ2: How can alternative (i.e. non-numerical) representations of biodata foster critical reflection on the body as a site of political contestation?/body as a site of knowledge?

### Week 6
This week: 
- get equipment/put together a [BOM](bom.md)
- fabrication first steps: getting a strong signal (maybe make our own biosensors? Here's an example of a [DIY GSR sensor](http://ftmedia.eu/diy-gsr-sensor/) where the body serves as a resistor in the circuit; increases in skin conductivity decrease the overall circuit resistance and yield a reading. [This guy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljVQpwVHpOo&feature=emb_logo) is a good complement.)
- researching technical implementations/tools
- focusing on the text messaging & portrait interactions
- deciding on a context and a few RQs
- NordiCHI workshop on Thursday (and then Monday and Tuesday next week)
