## Weekly log
### Week 10
What happened the last three weeks!? Gab had prelims and then it was Thanksgiving! 

Last week, Gab tried to make [this circuit](http://www.chris3000.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Gsr02.jpg) but didn't have the necessary [op amps](https://www.digchip.com/datasheets/parts/datasheet/041/OP471A.php). Then she tried to have two microcontrollers talk to one another but needed WiFi-enabled microcontrollers (such as AF's [feather Huzzah](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821) â€“ out of stock).

In the spirit of working with what she has, which is a bunch of standard electronic parts, she'll try to turn her generic ultrasonic sensor into a breath sensor (inspiration [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4179033/pdf/sensors-14-15371.pdf)).

Also, [DIS is happening this year!](https://dis.acm.org/2021/) Should we try to make the paper/pictorial deadline (prob late Jan)?

I think we need to think about RQ2 more and how it's actually explored in this work. I've been thinking about: 
- the politics of knowledge: which knowledge is valid, which is not, how does technology propagates a certain type of knowledge -- but does it? That, in and of itself, is an interesting question. We assume digital tech deploys a certain logic into the world but does it?
- Politics of knowledge bring us back to Foucault, and also Isabelle Stengers
- [Human-Computer Insurrection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06167.pdf) (which I suspect is a nod to the [Coming Insurrection](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/comite-invisible-the-coming-insurrection))

### Week 7
This week:
- making stuff!
  - Blair explores text message based interaction
  - Gabrielle explores sensory feedback at  a distance
- Research Questions:
  - RQ1: How can biodata foster long-distance intimacy?
  - RQ2: How can alternative (i.e. non-numerical) representations of biodata foster critical reflection on the body as a site of political contestation?/body as a site of knowledge?

### Week 6
This week: 
- get equipment/put together a [BOM](bom.md)
- fabrication first steps: getting a strong signal (maybe make our own biosensors? Here's an example of a [DIY GSR sensor](http://ftmedia.eu/diy-gsr-sensor/) where the body serves as a resistor in the circuit; increases in skin conductivity decrease the overall circuit resistance and yield a reading. [This guy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljVQpwVHpOo&feature=emb_logo) is a good complement.)
- researching technical implementations/tools
- focusing on the text messaging & portrait interactions
- deciding on a context and a few RQs
- NordiCHI workshop on Thursday (and then Monday and Tuesday next week)

### Week 5
This week, a few sketches, more literature, precising an interaction.
