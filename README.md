## Weekly log

### Week 6
This week: 
- get equipment/put together a [BOM](bom.md)
- fabrication first steps: getting a strong signal (maybe make our own biosensors? Here's an example of a [DIY GSR sensor](http://ftmedia.eu/diy-gsr-sensor/) where the body serves as a resistor in the circuit; increases in skin conductivity decrease the overall circuit resistance and yield a reading. [This guy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljVQpwVHpOo&feature=emb_logo) is a good complement.)
- researching technical implementations/tools
- focusing on the text messaging & portrait interactions
- deciding on a context and a few RQs
- NordiCHI workshop on Thursday (and then Monday and Tuesday next week)
