## Bill of Materials
- microcontroller(s):
  - arduinos & compatible knockoffs 
  - ada circuit playgrounds
  - if we're feeling it, [tinyML boards](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-sense) or [tiny microcontrollers](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny85)
- stuff to build a circuit:
  - breadboard
  - alligator clips/jumper wires
  - assortment of resistors
  - capacitors 
  - stuff to test output: LEDs are good, maybe mini LCD, speaker, servo/stepper?
  - stuff to test circuit: 
  - stuff to play: photoresistor, button, potentiometer
  - batteries (3v, 5v) 
  - power supply (9V)
  - ...
