## Logging Text Data
Following up on the [provocation](https://github.com/bsubbaraman/ABSR/blob/gh-pages/posts/blair_post_wk10.md#another-text-based-provocation) from last week:

- sorted each poem in Maggie Nelson's _Bluets_ by sentiment (see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goRS_0dwEgb-lErcyWbZTDuRooh4LvWXZpBV-EW5CfQ/edit?usp=sharing)). (chosen as an example to lean in to the interpretation possible in poetry (and its form was conducive to 'logging')).
- map temperature reading [~70-85F] to sentiment [-1 (most neg),1 (most pos)], find closest match
- sample log from blowing on the sensor and letting it cool off (this ranges from most positive (sentiment score ~0.9) to neutral (sentiment score ~0.1):

> The half-circle of blinding turquoise ocean is this love’s primal scene. That this blue exists makes my life a remarkable one, just to have seen it. To have seen such beautiful things. To find oneself placed in their midst. Choiceless. I returned there yesterday and stood again upon the mountain.

> This idea has its charms, but I think it possible that I have watched too many blue movies for it to have a lasting hold on me. If you grow accustomed to wall-to-wall, even the slightest shred of mystery or plot can become an agitation. Who cares why these people have found themselves in this banal, suburban tract home in Burbank? He is not a delivery man; she is not a bored housewife. They are not the stars—their orifices are. Let them open.

> It often happens that we count our days, as if the act of measurement made us some kind of promise. But really this is like hoisting a harness onto an invisible horse. “There is simply no way that a year from now you’re going to feel the way you feel today,” a different therapist said to me last year at this time. But though I have learned to act as if I feel differently, the truth is that my feelings haven’t really changed.

 > On the other hand, it must be admitted that there are aftereffects, impressions that linger long after the external cause has been removed, or has removed itself. “If anyone looks at the sun, he may retain the image in his eyes for several days,” Goethe wrote. “Boyle relates an image of ten years.” And who is to say this afterimage is not equally real? Indigo makes its stain not in the dyeing vat, but after the garment has been removed. It is the oxygen of the air that blues it.
 
 > Consider the case of Mr. Sidney Bradford, however, whose corneal opacities were grafted away at the age of fifty-two. After his vision was restored, he became unexpectedly disconsolate. “He found the world drab, and was upset by flaking paint and other blemishes; he liked bright colours, but became depressed when they faded.” Not long after he gained vision and saw the world in full color, he “died in unhappiness.”
 
 > What I know: when I met you, a blue rush began. I want you to know, I no longer hold you responsible.
