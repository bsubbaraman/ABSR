## Dev Progress
TL;DR extended timeline means more time for ideas/learning/mistakes. Hooray!

I had what I thought was a great idea to turn BodyTeller to an app on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) that would let us collaborate on code together/share easily with others/not have to worry about servers so much/etc etc. After a bit of work on sending POST data from a sensor to a webpage, I realized the disk space offered isn't enough for BodyTeller, which is using e.g. a large corpus for NLP :( oops. On the bright side, I learned some stuff - hooray for learning experiences and breathable timelines!

## Misc
- Does Gabrielle have an extra ESP8266/nodeMCU that I should grab?
- Noura Howell’s ‘Ripple’ had a push-button for manual override, which allowed wearers to turn on the lights of their garment. Might think about a button like this on BodyTeller, with the text decorated differently in some way? This also feeds into questions about logging frequency and the extent to which we give ourselves control over the frequency.

## Reading Group
We talked a bit about reading some work together to ground our research. Here's some (possibly) relevant readings:
