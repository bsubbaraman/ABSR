## Text Message Ineraction 

### Some (Very) Related Research
The literature gathered about The Project in general is certainly still related here, but there's a good bit of work specifically around text messages + physiological signals. Here's a start:

Communicating emotions in online chat using physiological sensors and animated text.](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/papers/chi2004.pdf) In <i>CHI '04 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems</i> (<i>CHI EA '04</i>).

In general these projects seem to (1) take biodata as 'real', mapping one-to-one onto actual emotion and (2) practical, looking at how 'optimize meaning' in text-based communication. Consequently, there might be space for a design intervention which is (1) critical, complicating the meaning associated with biosignals and (2) maintains a poetic edge, prompting individual and mutual reflection engagement rather than increasing the information density of text messages.
