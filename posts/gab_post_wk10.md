Since I only have a bunch of generic parts, my option were limited. I found [a paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4179033/) that also uses a generic (40 kHz) ultrasound sensor to create a breath sensor. They use an IIR filter afterwards to isolate the breathing. I might be able to replicate the system in hacky way to have a decent enough breath sensor that's not in your face.
