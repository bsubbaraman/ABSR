Last week, I tried to make [this circuit](http://www.chris3000.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Gsr02.jpg) but didn't have the necessary [op amps](https://www.digchip.com/datasheets/parts/datasheet/041/OP471A.php). Then I tried to have two microcontrollers talk to one another but needed WiFi-enabled microcontrollers (such as AF's [feather Huzzah](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821) â€“ out of stock).

Since I only have a bunch of generic parts, my option were limited. I found [a paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4179033/) that also uses a generic (40 kHz) ultrasound sensor to create a breath sensor. They use an IIR filter afterwards to isolate the breathing. I might be able to replicate the system in hacky way to have a decent enough breath sensor that's not in your face.
