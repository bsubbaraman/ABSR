## slow progress
Actually got to send data to a web page but not really getting a clear sensor signal.  

**The circuit**

**Materials**
ESP8266/nodeMCU
1k resistor
LDR
jumper wires
breadboard
micro usb to USB B

**Sensor reading?**

**Debugging next steps**    
My resistor might be too big (1k). I'll swap it for a potentiometer which will give me more control over sensitivity.


## refining RQs
1. What happens when biosensing data generates narratives? How are these narratives read and how is the biosensing data understood?
2. How does this mode of biosensing data representation subvert (or reinforce) assumptions about the body in comouting and interactive tech design? (Daniela's comment on techno determination)
3. Can this mode of biosensing data representation enable new historical readings? (if it can at all -- thinking of [Jentery Sayers' cultural history kits](http://hyperrhiz.io/hyperrhiz13/workshops-kits/early-wearables.html)).
4. Can design inquiry methods be extended through ethnography?

## thoughts on the general pace and format of the project
Thoughts evolve much faster than things and this project, as a design inquiry, is also about the process of making and fine-tuning the interaction. So perhaps something interesting would be to create detailed "making log" entries, weaving in things we learnt each week both on the design and theoretical (or historical) side. Basically elevating the weekly posts to legit auto-ethnographic investigations.
