## slow progress
Actually got to send data to a web page but not really getting a clear sensor signal.  

**The circuit**

**Materials**  
ESP8266/nodeMCU  
1k resistor  
LDR  
jumper wires  
breadboard  
micro usb to USB B  

**Sensor reading?**

Very unsual reading for an ldr (I was expecting more in the 700s). It also barely changes. My resistor's probably be too big.

I also tried to send the data to a spreadsheet with [pushingbox](https://www.pushingbox.com/) but while the nodeMCU seems to be sending it *somewhere* it ain't my spreadsheet.

**Debugging next steps**    
I'll swap the resistor for a potentiometer which will give me more control over sensor sensitivity.


## refining RQs
1. What happens when biosensing data generates narratives? How are these narratives read and how is the biosensing data understood?
2. How does this mode of biosensing data representation subvert (or reinforce) assumptions about the body in comouting and interactive tech design? (Daniela's comment on techno determination)
3. Can this mode of biosensing data representation enable new historical readings? (if it can at all -- thinking of [Jentery Sayers' cultural history kits](http://hyperrhiz.io/hyperrhiz13/workshops-kits/early-wearables.html)).
4. Can design inquiry methods be extended through ethnography? (the "auto-extensions" Daniela suggested: a method of design inquiry as auto-ethnographic).

## thoughts on the general pace and format of the project
Thoughts evolve much faster than things and this project, as a design inquiry, is also about the process of making and fine-tuning the interaction. So perhaps it could be interesting to create detailed "making log" entries, weaving in things we learn each week both on the design and theoretical (or historical) sides. Basically elevating the weekly posts to legit auto-ethnographic investigations (perhaps they already are but being more intentional about it?).
