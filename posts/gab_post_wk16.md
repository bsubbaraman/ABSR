### Brief summary of last week

1. We re-evaluated the timeline
2. We established a new production plan
3. Blair got a thermal printer
4. Blair also made a great design suggestion, the override button
5. Gab suggested we read stuff together, starting with Ingoe's *Making Things Talk* 3rd ed (chap 2 + 6, but in retrospect, chap 3 and 4 are also super useful)
