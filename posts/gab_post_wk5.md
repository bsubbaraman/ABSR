## Fleshing Out Ideas
Two short write ups about possible interactions we might decide to focus on and one reflection on the body in computation.

## Portraiture in HCI

User research and studies us an  important component of interaction design and of Human-Computer Interaction. Designers use a wide range of strategies to get to “know” their users,  from qualitative approaches (ethnographic studies, interviews, surveys) to quantitative (data patterns, stats) to more speculative ones (cultural probes).

“Users” rarely have the occasion, however, to co-create or co-participate in how their data is shaped, how they are represented and accounted for in the designs of designers.

The interaction here explores how people can intervene in the representation of their bodies for biosensing interactive technologies, such as health consumer applications and objects tied to the quantified self movement.

Instrumented with an EMG, the participant tries to remain as still as possible in order to create a “accurate” portrait of themselves; the more they move, the more distorted/blurry/abstract the image becomes. The participant can affect the parameters of the interaction by dialing the distortion up or down. They can also decide to move a lot and to create ambiguous or enigmatic self-representations.

Once they’re satisfied with their portrait, they can print it out/send it to their phone/send it to a website  that will then serve as a database for designers.

Alternatively, two or three participants could explore representation simultaneously, creating a collective image. Similar to the face swap apps and app features but with biosensing data, creating an embodied, sensory collective portrait.

This interaction invites participants to question what parameters and decisions went into the representation of their sensory experience/physiological processes and how much control they can exert over these representations.

## Texting with biosignals

Language is not a model of the world but a model of thoughts; as such, it always hints at a consciousness, which is why voice assistants and fictional figures like Samantha in Jonze’s movie her or Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey have so captured our collective imagination.

Contrary to the premise of our dualist heritage, and according to recent research in neuroscience, cognitive science and psycholinguistics, thoughts and bodily processes are intrinsically linked [REF]. Language, therefore, is not only a model of thought processes but of sensory experience as well. 

In this interaction, we propose to explore the idea of language production and understanding as an embodied phenomenon [Gibbs 1994; 2005]. Two people converse with each other but instead of using their fingers to form sentences, they “use” their biosignals to select words and try to communicate. Through muscle contraction and relaxation (EMG sensors ––or maybe through skin conductivity? Impossible to control though), the participants generate words that they can then decide to send or delete and try again.

Alternatively, participants have no control about what they can send and through muscle activity (brain activity? movement? breath? very undecided about the nature of the signal) produce sentences that are shared with someone else, and then they receive sentences from the other person produced in the same way.

The problem with that is that there is a big lack of control that can be frustrating/feel arbitrary.

## The politics of body and computation

At a very high level, the body is something that has been ditched pretty early on in the modern scientific enterprise. Descartes’ cogito, the industrial age and mechanization of the body (check out [Triple Canopy’s Bodies Against Time project](https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/bodies_against_time), which deals among other things with the body and its tied to capitalism) .

Later, in computer science, much of the work was inspired by cognitivism, which postulates that humans rely primarily on internal models to function in the world. Computer scientists figured that computers could work similarly, which is convenient because models are easier for machines to understand rather than, say, sensory/situated decision-making (see Lucy Suchman’s Plans and Situated Actions –– HCI hasn’t even begun to unpack what that work means). 

More specifically, in HCI today, how are bodies modeled? That’s a vast question, because there’s so much modeling of various biological processes… but use looking at outputs, and what is being done with these models and this bio sending data, I think it’s safe to say that it still fall under a somewhat capitalist/productivist attitude, where bodies need to be optimized for well-being and efficiency. Noura’s Emotional Biosensing article is a good starting point here.

Going wide again: what is the relationship between bodies and technology? [Marcel Mauss’ Les techniques du corps/Techniques of the body (1950)](https://monoskop.org/images/c/c4/Mauss_Marcel_1935_1973_Techniques_of_the_Body.pdf) postulates that there are techniques of the body that are developed and perfected in relations to other technologies. For instance, digging is a body technique of how you hold the spade, how much pressure you apply on it, the exact force you must exert, the trajectory of your arm to efficiently move dirt around. Same with walking, eating, how you position your hands, etc. What’s interesting in Mauss’ work is the idea that these techniques of the body are not just physical but also psychological and sociological. The body articulates many different dimensions in that regard: our relationship to our environment (mediated by objects and tools, often); our relationships with others; our emotional and intellectual life.
